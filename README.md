## Why Menagerist?

**Menagerist** is inspired by the idea of a *menagerie* — a carefully curated collection. It’s designed to make organizing, linking, and preserving your collections simple and meaningful.

> A subtle nod to *Star Trek: The Original Series – The Menagerie*.

Whether you’re tracking memorabilia, events, or people, Menagerist gives you a central, self-hosted place to keep everything connected and easy to find.
